MongoDB for Kohana 3.x
======================

Mango
-----

Mango is an ORM/ActiveRecord like library that takes full advantage of MongoDB's features. Mango supports:
* **Atomic updates** - the library will calculate what values changed, and will update only those values using atomic modifiers like $set, $push/$pull and $inc
* **All Mongo datatypes** including embedded objects, arrays, enums and (multidimensional) counters
* Relationships you remember from the RDBMS world like has_one, belongs_to, has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many
* Validation of object data, including embedded objects
* Class Table Extension-like behavior - eg Model_Ferrari extends Model_Car extends Mango.
* Very easy syntax very familiar to users of other ORMs

MangoDB
-------

A simple wrapper to access MongoDB. Store your database info in a config file and access MongoDB from anywhere in your code using MangoDB::instance().
